            <h2>What are about Mosasaurus</h2>
            <p>Mosasaurus is an extinct aquatic reptile that lived at the very end of the Cretaceous Period, from around 82.7 to 66 million years ago. Mosasaurus was not a dinosaur; like other mosasaurs, it was descended from lizards that originally lived on land. Because of this, Mosasaurus belongs to the reptilian order Squamata, which contains all lizards and snakes.</p>
            <p>Mosasaurus lived in the Atlantic Ocean and in connected seas, such as the Western Interior Seaway, which divided North America into two separate landmasses for much of the Cretaceous Period.</p>
            <p>Mosasaurus was a large, powerful, fast-moving and well-armed predator that likely sat at the top of the food-chain in the oceans of the Mesozoic Era.</p>
            <p>Mosasaurus lived from around 82.7 to 66 million years ago, at the very end of the Cretaceous Period. It became extinct in the Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction Event that also wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, ammonites, and many other animals and plants.</p>

            <h2>Facts about Mosasaurus</h2>
            <p>The name Mosasaurus means: “Lizard of the Meuse River”.</p>
            <p>The Mosasaurus lived in the Late Cretaceous Period between 66 and 70 million years ago.</p>
            <p>The largest discovered specimen of Mosasaurus had a length of up to 56 feet.</p>
            <p>The length of the Mosasaurus was greater then the fearsome Tyrannosaur rex.</p>
            <p>The teeth of a Mosasaurus were shaped like sharp spikes, allowing them grip and hold onto their prey.</p>
            <p>The double-hinged jaw of the Mosasaurus would allow it to swallow its prey whole.</p>
            <p>The Mosasaurus spent most of its time near the ocean surface, much like modern whales do, since they breathed air in a similar fashion.</p>
